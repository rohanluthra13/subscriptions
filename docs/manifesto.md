# Manifesto


## what

- i want an AI assistant to manage my subscriptions for me, to help me keep track of what i pay for, and to suggest how i can improve my personal stack
- it should not be a subscription service

## why

- because everything is a subscription and it's ridiculous
- because paying a subscription to a 'subscription manager' is just a bit suss
- because I agree with and am inspired by the ethos of Once by 37 Signals

## how

- by using what already exists (e.g. email)
- by leveraging a core AI subscription (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc) instead of adding yet another to the list
- by not storing data; your data stays with you

## for whom

- this is for anyone who can use LLMs, whether that be a chatbot (ChatGPT etc.), CLI agent (Claude Code etc.) or IDE (Cursor etc.) 
- this should not require technical/programming/IT knowledge to use
