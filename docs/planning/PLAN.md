# Subscription Manager - Development Plan

## Overview
Build a lightweight subscription tracking tool that processes Gmail daily, uses LLM to identify subscriptions, and provides insights through a dashboard.

## Development Approach
Discovery phase completed - comprehensive technical design and architectural decisions documented. Ready for implementation workplan and resource allocation.

## Discovery Phase âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Completed Analysis
- âœ… Zero email architecture patterns analyzed and adapted
- âœ… Gmail integration strategy defined (OAuth + on-demand fetching)
- âœ… Processing pipeline architecture designed (daily batch + manual refresh)
- âœ… Database schema specified (PostgreSQL with multi-user foundation)
- âœ… LLM integration approach decided (direct OpenAI API calls)
- âœ… Infrastructure planned (Docker Compose deployment)

### Discovery Phase Outputs âœ… **DELIVERED**
1. âœ… **`DESIGN.md`** - Complete technical design with architecture, database schema, processing flows, API design
2. âœ… **`DECISIONS.md`** - 6 architectural decision records covering all major technical choices
3. âœ… **Updated `README.md`** - Refined MVP features and accurate tech stack

## Implementation Phases (Ready for Resource Allocation)

Based on technical design in `DESIGN.md`, the implementation is divided into 4 parallel workstreams:

### Week 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
**Target**: Core project setup and database foundation
- Next.js 14 project setup with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma schema implementation
- Docker Compose configuration
- Basic authentication framework
- Environment configuration

### Week 2: Gmail Integration & Processing Pipeline  
**Target**: Email fetching and batch processing
- Gmail OAuth 2.0 integration
- Gmail API service (on-demand fetching)
- Batch processing orchestrator
- Daily cron scheduler setup
- Email processing log system

### Week 3: LLM Integration & Subscription Detection
**Target**: Core business logic
- OpenAI API integration
- Subscription detection service
- Deduplication logic
- Confidence scoring system
- Category classification

### Week 4: Dashboard & User Interface
**Target**: Complete user experience
- Next.js dashboard components
- Subscription list with search/filter
- Manual sync controls with progress tracking
- Edit/delete subscription functionality
- CSV export capability
- Error handling and validation

### Week 5: Polish & Production Ready
**Target**: Deployment ready
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Documentation completion
- Testing and bug fixes
- Deployment verification
